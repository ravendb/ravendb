1. License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor allows you to
use the provided client library under the MIT open source license solely in
order to communicate with the RavenDB application and allows you to use all
other RavenDB server software publicly available on the RavenDB website
under the terms of the AGPLv3 license, a copy of which is available at
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html.

Notwithstanding the above, upon your receipt of a product license key for the
RavenDB software as a result of your subscription through the RavenDB
website then, during the term that such product license key is effective, your
use of the Software shall no longer be governed by the AGPLv3 but shall
instead be governed by the terms of this EULA, and the specific rights and
scope of the license received will be determined based upon which license
you select to purchase from the Raven DB buy page (the “Buy Page”). All
such licenses grant you the non-exclusive, non-transferable, nonsublicensable
right to use the provided Software and modify non-compiled
source files of the provided Software, all for your own internal commercial purposes,
and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other
restrictions and obligations set forth on the Buy Page.
For the sake of clarity it is hereby clarified that for as long as you have effective
license key, you may switch or upgrade to a new released version for no additional
charge, however if such new version comprises additional features that were
not available to you under the current version, then you will be required to pay
the applicable prices under the Buy Page in order to use such new features.
Once your license key expires and you choose not to renew the subscription period,
then you shall no longer be entitled to use RavenDB software under the terms
of this EULA and must delete the software from your servers or otherwise
use it under the terms of the AGPLv3 license, as mentioned above. 


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing paragraph, 
you may host the Software on behalf of your end users solely in conjunction with your 
applications; provided that yours' end users shall not, at any time, access the Software
directly, without a written consent of the Licensor.
For the avoidance of all doubt, if you use a developer license you may be required
to manually renew your license every 6 months (or such other period determined by Licensor),
and manually obtain the applicable certificates for the new period.
