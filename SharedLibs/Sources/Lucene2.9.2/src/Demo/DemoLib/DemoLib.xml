            Simply add the cases to the switch for all those special cases.
            For example, if you have a subclass of Token called IDToken that
            you want to create if ofKind is ID, simlpy add something like :
            
            case MyParserConstants.ID : return new IDToken();
            
            to the following switch statement. Then you can cast matchedToken
            variable to the appropriate type and use it in your lexical actions.

            "currentToken" and "expectedTokenSequences" to generate a parse
            error message and returns it.  If this object has been created
            due to a parse error, and you do not catch it (it gets thrown
            from the parser), then this method is called during the printing
            of the final stack trace, and hence the correct error message
            gets displayed.
